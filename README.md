The use of iLOC for subsetting a dataset and to create Functions in pythons
The initial step here is to import the respective libraries in the jupyter notebook with the assistance of python language.
Now once the libraries are imported, In part 1, the next step is to let the use of df function to read the csv format file “vsales.csv” into the python environment. Through this df function we used the iLOC function to select a specific row or column from the dataset “vsales.csv”. we have retrieved the value “1000”. After that to see what the data set looks like, we used the head() method.
In part 2, we define a function as “def” in that we have added a welcome message i.e., “Welcome customers to pizza shop” and added the name of the customers waiting that is ‘nur’,’jacklyn’,and ‘mazz’. After that function takes a list and uses a loop to print waiting list of the customers. Also printed a message to the customers ‘poorna’, ’sid’, ‘surhabi’, ‘halima’, ‘mo’, ‘tunji’ that “Your pizza is almost ready”. 
After that we define a function “def” for row and column selection and this function is used to dynamically slice data from a users dataframe. “row_select” represents the rows the user wants and “col_select” represents the columns the user wants.
